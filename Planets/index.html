                                            Mercury is the smallest planet in
                                            the Solar System and the closest to
                                            the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
                                            takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest
                                            of all the Sun's planets.

                                            It is named after the Roman god
                                            Mercurius (Mercury), god of
                                            commerce, messenger of the gods, and
                                            mediator between gods and mortals,
                                            corresponding to the Greek god

                                            About 29.2% of Earth's surface is

                                            after the Roman god Jupiter, the
                                            king of the gods, because of its

                                            Uranus is the seventh planet from
                                            the Sun. Its name is a reference to
                                            the Greek god of the sky, Uranus,
                                            who, according to Greek mythology,
                                            was the great-grandfather of Ares
                                            (Mars), grandfather of Zeus
                                            (Jupiter) and father of Cronus
                                            (Saturn).

                                            It has the third-largest planetary
                                            radius and fourth-largest planetary
                                            mass in the Solar System. Uranus is
                                            similar in composition to Neptune,
                                            and both have bulk chemical
                                            compositions which differ from that
                                            of the larger gas giants Jupiter and
                                            Saturn.

                                            For this reason, scientists often
                                            classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice
                                            giants" to distinguish them from the
                                            other giant planets.
